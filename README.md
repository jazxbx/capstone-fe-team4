# A recipe book app to keep recipes. 

This is a recipe book app I made to help me organize and manage recipes efficiently.

- Refactored Frontend: The frontend of the application has been refactored, transitioning from JavaScript to TypeScript. This enhances the codebase's readability, maintainability, and scalability.
- Built with React + TypeScript
